<h1>Wineka: Data Collection with Optical Character Recognition</h1>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

This project contains the code used to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract tabular data for the Wineka project. 

The initial code for the project is based on <a href="https://livefiredev.com/how-to-extract-table-from-image-in-python-opencv-ocr/">this article explaining how to apply OCR on tabular data</a>

<h3>Data format</h3>
Here is a sample of the data we are trying to extract.
